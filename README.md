#zipline

This is a perl/bash reimplementation of adamnemecek's zipline (with slight UI changes) that should work on more than just OS X. Again, pure bash would be better and less of a hassle to install, but at least perl is a bit more portable than Swift.

Zipline allows you to select a directory higher up in your current path and switch to it without messing around with "cd ../../..".

##Installation

Move or put a symlink to zl.pl in your path as zipline and add the contents of zl.sh to your .bashrc/.bash_profile.
